# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on Multiple Datasets

Welcome to the repository where I have conducted detailed **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on various datasets. This project showcases my data exploration and preprocessing skills, aiming to extract meaningful insights and prepare data for further modeling tasks.

## üìÇ Project Overview

This repository contains EDA performed on the following datasets:

1. **House Prices Prediction**  
   - **Dataset:** Features related to house attributes like area, location, and pricing.  
   - **Goal:** Understand factors affecting house prices and prepare data for predictive modeling.

2. **Zomato Dataset**  
   - **Dataset:** Information about restaurants, cuisines, ratings, and costs.  
   - **Goal:** Analyze restaurant trends and customer preferences.

3. **Flight Price Prediction**  
   - **Dataset:** Flight details including airline, duration, and price.  
   - **Goal:** Identify key features influencing flight ticket prices.

4. **Algerian Forest Fires**  
   - **Dataset:** Meteorological data and fire occurrence information.  
   - **Goal:** Explore patterns related to forest fires in Algeria.

## üìä Key Features

- **Data Cleaning:**  
  - Handled missing values, duplicates, and outliers.  
  - Transformed and normalized data where required.

- **Univariate and Multivariate Analysis:**  
  - Visualized individual feature distributions using histograms, box plots, and pie charts.  
  - Explored relationships between features using scatter plots, heatmaps, and pair plots.

- **Feature Engineering:**  
  - Derived new variables to enrich dataset insights.  
  - Applied encoding techniques for categorical variables.

- **Insights and Observations:**  
  - Highlighted trends, anomalies, and actionable findings for each dataset.

## üìà Results and Observations

1. **House Prices Prediction:**  
   - Found location and area to be key factors affecting pricing.  
   - Identified multicollinearity in numeric features.  

2. **Zomato Dataset:**  
   - Higher-rated restaurants tend to have mid-range pricing.  
   - Popular cuisines vary significantly across cities.

3. **Flight Price Prediction:**  
   - Ticket prices strongly influenced by duration and stopovers.  
   - Seasonal trends observed in pricing.

4. **Algerian Forest Fires:**  
   - Strong correlation between temperature and fire occurrences.  
   - Identified potential thresholds for fire risk based on meteorological conditions.
